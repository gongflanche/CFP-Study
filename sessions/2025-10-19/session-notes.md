## Practice Problems Completed

### Question 1: Charitable Contribution - Tangible Personal Property (E.43)

**Topic**: E.43 Charitable contributions and deductions - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Client donated antique vase (purchased 13 years ago for $1,700) to qualified charity. Charity promptly sold it for $3,250. What amount can client deduct?
- Answer choices: $0, $1,550, $1,700, $3,250

**Student's Response**: [Awaiting answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **$1,700** (original cost basis)

**Explanation Given**:

**The "Related Use" Rule for Tangible Personal Property**:

When donating tangible personal property (antiques, art, collectibles):

**If charity KEEPS and USES it (Related Use)**:
- Deduction = Fair Market Value (FMV)
- Example: Donate painting to museum that displays it = deduct FMV

**If charity SELLS it (Unrelated Use)**:
- Deduction = LESSER of (Cost Basis OR FMV)
- Example: Donate to charity that auctions it = deduct basis only

**Why $1,700**:
- Charity "promptly sold it" = unrelated use
- Deduction = LESSER of ($1,700 basis OR $3,250 FMV)
- Answer: $1,700

**Key Learning**: Appreciated property sold by charity = donor only deducts basis, not appreciated FMV. This prevents donors from getting deduction for gains the charity actually realized.

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood concept after explanation with authoritative sources (IRS Publication 526)

**Source**: IRS Publication 526 - researched online per CLAUDE.md verification protocol

### Question 2: Estimated Tax Safe Harbor Rules (E.37)

**Topic**: E.37 Income tax fundamentals and calculations - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Married couple with:
- Last year: AGI $140,000, paid $15,000 federal tax
- This year: Won $5,000,000 lottery, took $3,200,000 lump sum
- This year: Anticipate owing $750,000 in federal tax
- Question: Amount to pay each quarter in estimated taxes to avoid underpayment penalties?
- Answer choices: $3,750, $4,125, $168,750, $187,500

**Student's Response**: [Awaiting answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **$3,750** per quarter

**Safe Harbor Rules Explained**:

To avoid underpayment penalties, pay the LESSER of:
1. 90% of current year's tax, OR
2. 100% of prior year's tax (if prior year AGI ≤ $150,000), OR
3. 110% of prior year's tax (if prior year AGI > $150,000)

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:

**Which rule applies?**
- Prior year AGI: $140,000 (under $150,000 threshold)
- Use 100% rule (not 110%)

**Calculate each option**:
1. 90% of current year: $750,000 × 90% = $675,000 ÷ 4 = **$168,750/quarter**
2. 100% of prior year: $15,000 × 100% = $15,000 ÷ 4 = **$3,750/quarter**

**Use LESSER amount**: $3,750 per quarter

**Key Insight**: Safe harbor protects taxpayers with sudden income spikes (lottery, bonuses, business sales). As long as they pay what they paid last year, no underpayment penalty - even though they'll owe huge balance when filing.

**Critical Detail**: Prior year AGI ($140,000) determines the threshold, NOT current year's lottery winnings.

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student grasped the protective nature of safe harbor rules

### Question 3: Tax Credits vs Tax Deductions (E.40)

**Topic**: E.40 Tax reduction/management techniques - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Taxpayer in 32% marginal tax bracket, itemizes deductions. Which provides GREATEST tax savings?
- $1,320 child support payments
- $1,000 additional itemized deductions
- $800 short-term capital loss
- $355 tax credit

**Student's Response**: [Awaiting answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **$355 tax credit**

**Tax Savings Calculation for Each**:

1. **$1,320 child support payments**:
   - NOT DEDUCTIBLE (child support is tax-neutral per IRS)
   - Tax savings = **$0**

2. **$1,000 itemized deductions**:
   - Reduces taxable income by $1,000
   - Savings = $1,000 × 32% = **$320**

3. **$800 short-term capital loss**:
   - Can offset ordinary income (up to $3,000/year limit)
   - Reduces taxable income by $800
   - Savings = $800 × 32% = **$256**

4. **$355 tax credit**:
   - Dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax owed
   - Tax savings = **$355**

**Ranking (Greatest to Least)**:
1. ✅ $355 tax credit = $355 savings
2. $1,000 deductions = $320 savings
3. $800 capital loss = $256 savings
4. $1,320 child support = $0 savings

**Key Concept: Tax Credits vs Tax Deductions**:

**Tax Credit**:
- Dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax owed
- $355 credit saves exactly $355 regardless of tax bracket

**Tax Deduction**:
- Reduces taxable income
- Value depends on marginal tax bracket
- $1,000 deduction in 32% bracket = $1,000 × 32% = $320 savings
- Same $1,000 deduction in 12% bracket = only $120 savings

**The Rule**: Tax credit ALWAYS worth more than equal-dollar deduction
- $355 credit beats $355 deduction (which would save only $355 × 32% = $114)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student said "great!" indicating strong comprehension

**Sources Verified**:
- IRS rules on child support (not deductible)
- Tax credit vs deduction comparison (multiple tax sources)
- Capital loss deduction rules (up to $3,000 ordinary income offset)

---

## Key Concepts Mastered

### E.43 Charitable Contributions
- **Related Use Rule**: Charity keeps/uses = FMV deduction
- **Unrelated Use Rule**: Charity sells = basis deduction only
- **Formula**: Deduction = LESSER of (basis OR FMV) when unrelated use
- **Purpose**: Prevents donors from deducting gains charity actually received

### E.37 Estimated Tax Payments
- **Safe Harbor Options**: Lesser of 90% current OR 100%/110% prior year
- **AGI Threshold**: $150,000 determines 100% vs 110% rule
- **Key Point**: Prior year AGI determines threshold, not current year
- **Protection**: Sudden income spikes won't trigger penalty if pay prior year amount
- **Quarterly Payment**: Annual amount ÷ 4

### E.40 Tax Reduction Techniques
- **Tax Credit**: $1 credit = $1 tax savings (any bracket)
- **Tax Deduction**: $1 deduction = (marginal rate × $1) tax savings
- **Child Support**: Not deductible (nor taxable to recipient)
- **Capital Losses**: Can offset up to $3,000 ordinary income/year
- **Comparison**: Credit always beats equal-dollar deduction

### Question 4: Qualified Dividends Taxation (E.37)

**Topic**: E.37 Income tax calculations - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Client earns $90,000 salary, received $2,500 qualified dividends, contributed $1,500 to retirement, no itemized deductions. How are qualified dividends taxed?
- They are included in taxable income and taxed at marginal rate
- They are taxed separately from other income at a lower rate ✓
- They increase AGI but are not taxable
- They must be reported but do not impact effective tax rate

**Student's Response**: [Did not answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **"They are taxed separately from other income at a lower rate"**

**Explanation Given**:

**How Qualified Dividends Are Taxed**:
- ✅ Included in AGI
- ✅ Included in taxable income
- ✅ BUT taxed at preferential capital gains rates (0%/15%/20%)
- ✅ NOT taxed at ordinary income rates

**Calculation Example**:
- AGI: $90,000 + $2,500 - $1,500 = $91,000
- Taxable income (single): $91,000 - $14,600 = $76,400
- At this income level: qualified dividends taxed at **15%**
- Tax on dividends: $2,500 × 15% = **$375**
- If ordinary: $2,500 × 22% = **$550**
- **Savings**: $175 from preferential treatment

**Key Learning**: Qualified dividends get preferential tax rates (same as long-term capital gains), not ordinary income rates.

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Understood the distinction between inclusion in income vs. rate of taxation

**Source**: IRS tax law on qualified dividends (verified online)

### Question 5: Tax Planning Strategy - Itemizing vs Credits (E.40)

**Topic**: E.40 Tax reduction/management techniques - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Jamie (Head of Household, 2 children, $90K income) has:
- Mortgage interest: $6,000
- Property taxes: $2,000
- Charitable donations: $3,000
- Medical expenses: $2,500
Which action should be prioritized?
- Increase charitable contributions
- Itemize all potential deductions
- Contribute additional funds to traditional IRA ✓
- Focus on qualifying for additional tax credits

**Student's Response**: [Did not answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **"Contribute additional funds to the traditional IRA"**

**Initial Analysis (INCORRECT)**:
I initially answered "Focus on qualifying for additional tax credits" - this was WRONG.

**Why I Was Wrong**:
- Child Tax Credit ($4,000 for 2 kids) is ALREADY available - no action needed
- Question asks what ACTION to prioritize
- "Focus on qualifying" doesn't require any specific action - she already qualifies

**Why IRA Contribution is Correct**:

**Should Jamie Itemize?**
- Standard deduction (HOH 2024): $21,900
- Medical expenses: $2,500 but threshold is 7.5% × $90K = $6,750, so $0 deductible
- Total itemized: $6,000 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $11,000
- **Standard deduction wins by $10,900!**

**IRA Contribution Analysis**:
- Can contribute up to $7,000 (2024 limit)
- Reduces AGI (above-the-line deduction)
- Tax savings: $7,000 × 22% marginal rate = **$1,540**
- This is an ACTIONABLE step she can take

**Why Other Options Wrong**:
- Increase charitable: Need $10,900+ more to beat standard deduction (wasteful)
- Itemize: Would LOSE $10,900 in deductions (terrible)
- Focus on credits: Already qualifies for child tax credit (no action needed)

**Key Learning**:
- Medical expense threshold = 7.5% of AGI (many people can't deduct)
- Compare itemized to standard deduction FIRST
- IRA contributions are above-the-line deductions (reduce AGI)
- Question asks for ACTIONABLE priorities, not already-available benefits

**Understanding Level**: Student knew correct answer immediately, I got it wrong!

**Error Analysis**: Misunderstood "focus on qualifying" as an action vs recognizing child tax credit already available without additional action

**Source**: IRS standard deduction amounts, medical expense thresholds, child tax credit rules (verified online)

### Question 6: Estate Income Tax Return (E.39)

**Topic**: E.39 Income taxation of trusts and estates - Tax Planning domain (14% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Jessica, executor of uncle's estate, must file federal income tax return. Estate includes:
- Cash: $50,000
- Stocks: $120,000
- Jewelry: $30,000
- Rental property: $15,000 annual income
- Debts: $40,000
Which income must estate report?
- Capital gains from sale of jewelry
- Dividends from the stocks ✓
- Debt repayments
- Interest earned on personal property

**Student's Response**: [Did not answer before explanation]

**Correct Answer**: **"Dividends from the stocks"**

**Explanation Given**:

**Form 1041 - Estate Income Tax Return**:

Estates are separate taxable entities that must report income earned AFTER death:
- Interest income (Line 1)
- Dividends (Line 2a) ✓
- Capital gains from sales (Line 4, Schedule D)
- Rental income
- Business income

**Filing requirement**: If estate earns ≥ $600 in annual income

**Why Each Option**:

1. **Capital gains from jewelry sale**: ❌
   - Only IF sold (problem doesn't say it was sold)
   - Jewelry is "valued at $30,000" but not sold = no gain

2. **Dividends from stocks**: ✅ CORRECT
   - Estate owns $120,000 in stocks
   - Stocks generate dividends
   - Dividends earned after death = taxable to estate
   - Report on Form 1041, Line 2a

3. **Debt repayments**: ❌
   - NOT income (never!)
   - Principal repayments reduce liabilities
   - Deductible on Form 706 (estate tax), NOT Form 1041 (income tax)

4. **Interest earned on personal property**: ❌
   - Confusing wording - jewelry doesn't "earn interest"
   - Cash earns interest, not personal property

**Additional Note**: The $15,000 rental income is DEFINITELY reportable but wasn't an answer choice.

**Key Learning**:
- Form 1041 = Estate/Trust Income Tax Return (income AFTER death)
- Form 706 = Estate Tax Return (value AT death)
- Dividends, interest, rent, capital gains = all reportable income
- Debt repayments ≠ income

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student grasped Form 1041 vs Form 706 distinction

**Source**: IRS Form 1041 Instructions and Publication 559 (verified online)

### Question 7: JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment (G.54)

**Topic**: G.54 Property titling and beneficiary designations - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Which feature of JTWROS affects taxation upon death of joint tenant?
- The property interest is included in the gross estate of the deceased tenant ✓
- The surviving joint tenant can receive a stepped-up basis in the full property value
- The property interest is automatically exempt from estate taxation
- The original property basis is adjusted to fair market value only for the deceased's share

**Student's Response**: Student knew correct answer; I initially got it wrong!

**Correct Answer**: **"The property interest is included in the gross estate of the deceased tenant"**

**My Initial Error**:
I chose "basis adjusted only for deceased's share" - which is TRUE for INCOME TAX, but the question asks about the primary feature "affecting TAXATION upon death" = ESTATE TAX, not future capital gains.

**Why This Is Correct**:

**JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment (IRC § 2040)**:

**For Spouses** (IRC § 2040(b)):
- **50% of property value** included in deceased's gross estate
- Used to calculate estate tax liability

**For Non-Spouses** (IRC § 2040(a)):
- **100% of property value** included in deceased's gross estate
- UNLESS survivor proves contribution ("consideration furnished" rule)
- Then only deceased's % contribution included

**Key Insight**: JTWROS avoids PROBATE but NOT estate tax

**The Critical Distinction**:
- ✅ JTWROS avoids **PROBATE** (state court process)
- ❌ JTWROS does **NOT** avoid **ESTATE TAX** (federal tax)
- Property IS included in gross estate for tax calculation
- If total estate > $13.61M (2024), it's taxable

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

❌ **"Full step-up in basis"**: Only in community property states, not JTWROS
❌ **"Automatically exempt from estate tax"**: FALSE - common misconception
✅ **"Basis adjusted only for deceased's share"**: TRUE but about income tax, not primary taxation feature

**Student's Question**: "It's really hard to remember all these different joint tenancy, JTWROS, other things when it comes to step-up cost basis, probate, etc. How to remember them easily?"

**Memory System Created**:

### **The 3 P's Test** (for any property type):
1. **PROBATE?** (Does it avoid probate?)
2. **PASS?** (Who gets it at death?)
3. **PERCENTAGE?** (What % step-up in basis?)

### **Quick Comparison Table**:

| Type | PROBATE? | ESTATE TAX? | STEP-UP % | MEMORY TRICK |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **JTWROS** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (included) | 50% (spouses) | Avoids probate ≠ avoids estate tax |
| **TIC** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES (deceased's %) | Deceased's % only | Through Inheritance Court |
| **Community Property** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (50%) | **100%** BOTH halves! | CAT WILL get full step-up |
| **Life Insurance** (to person) | ❌ NO | Depends | N/A | Beneficiary bypasses probate |
| **Sole Ownership** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES (100%) | 100% | Solo must probate |

### **JTWROS = 3 Different Things**:
1. **PROBATE**: Avoids it ✅ (goes directly to survivor)
2. **ESTATE TAX**: Does NOT avoid it ❌ (included in gross estate)
3. **INCOME TAX BASIS**: 50% step-up for spouses (affects future capital gains)

### **Community Property States - "CAT WILLs"**:
- **CA**lifornia, **A**rizona, **T**exas
- **W**ashington, **I**daho
- **L**ouisiana, **L**ouisiana (New Mexico, Nevada, Wisconsin)

**Key Learning**:
- The question asks about "affecting TAXATION" = estate tax inclusion
- Common trap: "avoids probate" ≠ "avoids estate tax"
- JTWROS property IS included in gross estate for estate tax calculation

**Understanding Level**: Student knew correct answer; I made error by focusing on step-up basis instead of estate tax inclusion

**Error Analysis**: Misread question focus - "affecting taxation upon death" = estate tax (primary), not future income tax (secondary)

**Source**: IRC Sections 2040(a) and 2040(b), IRS estate tax rules (verified online)

**Created comprehensive memory system**:
- "The 3 P's Test" (Probate, Pass, Percentage)
- Comparison table for all property types
- "CAT WILLs" mnemonic for community property states
- "JTWROS = 3 Different Things" framework

Student found this helpful for organizing complex estate planning rules.

## Notes

**Day 1 of 18-Day Study Plan** - Tax Planning and Estate Planning Focus

Excellent session with 7 practice problems covering Tax Planning (E.37, E.39, E.40, E.43) and Estate Planning (G.54). Student demonstrated strong understanding and even caught instructor error on JTWROS question.

**Key Learning Pattern**: Student benefits from:
1. Comparison tables and visual organization
2. Memory mnemonics for complex rules
3. Clear distinction between similar concepts (probate vs estate tax)

**Error Made by Instructor**: Misread JTWROS question as asking about step-up basis (income tax) instead of estate tax inclusion. Student knew correct answer immediately. Good reminder to focus on question's specific ask ("affecting taxation" = estate tax).

**Progress**:
- Tax Planning domain essentially complete (88%)
- Started Estate Planning domain (G.54 property titling)
- Created valuable memory aids for property titling rules

**Ready for**: Day 2 - E.38 Business Taxation (Section 179, MACRS) or continue with Estate Planning topics

**Session Status**: COMPLETE - saved per student request
