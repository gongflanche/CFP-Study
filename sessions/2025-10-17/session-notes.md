## Practice Problems - New Topics Tested

### Question 1: Required Minimum Distributions (F.51)

**Topic**: F.51 Distribution rules and taxation - Retirement Savings & Income Planning domain (18% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Sarah (born 1952, turned 73 in 2025) has traditional IRA worth $500,000 as of Dec 31, 2024.
- Part A: Does she need RMD in 2025?
- Part B: How much RMD? (distribution period = 26.5 years)

**Student's Answer**:

**Part A**:
- "Yes, because is more than 72.5 years old so she need to take RMD before 12/31 after her birthday"
- ✓ CORRECT conclusion (yes, needs RMD)
- Minor correction: Threshold is age 73 (not 72.5) for those born 1951-1959

**Part B**:
- "$500k / 26.5"
- ✓ PERFECT FORMULA
- Correct calculation: $500,000 ÷ 26.5 = $18,868

**Follow-up on April 1 delay and penalty**:
- Student understood: "She can delay her first withdrawal for that year until the April of the following year"
- ✓ CORRECT - First RMD only can be delayed to April 1 of following year
- Student calculated penalty: "$18,868 times 0.25 = $4,717"
- ✓ CORRECT - 25% excise tax on missed RMD

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Perfect grasp of:
- RMD age requirements
- RMD calculation formula (account balance ÷ life expectancy factor)
- April 1 delay exception for first RMD
- 25% penalty for missed RMD
- Risk of doubling up RMDs if delay first one

**Key Learning**:
- RMD ages: 73 for born 1951-1959, 75 for born 1960+
- First RMD can delay to April 1 (but creates 2 RMDs in one year)
- 25% penalty for missed RMD (reducible to 10% if corrected quickly)
- Roth IRAs: NO RMD during owner's lifetime

### Question 2: Time Value of Money (B.12)

**Topic**: B.12 Time value of money concepts and calculations - General Principles domain (15% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Maria wants $100,000 in 10 years. Investment earns 6% per year compounded annually. How much to invest today?

**Student's Answer**:
- Set up equation: "x × (1.06)^10 = 100k"
- Solved: "x ≈ $55,256.64"

**Evaluation**:
- ✓ PERFECT EQUATION SETUP - understood concept immediately
- Calculation slightly off: Correct answer $55,839.48
  - (1.06)^10 = 1.790848
  - 100,000 / 1.790848 = $55,839.48
- Student's $55,256.64 close but not exact (likely calculator rounding)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Demonstrated:
- Clear understanding of PV/FV relationship
- Correct formula application
- Strong mathematical skills
- **Note**: Student already knew this topic before our sessions

**Key Concepts Introduced (not tested)**:
- Future Value (FV) = amount in the future ($100k)
- Present Value (PV) = amount today (~$55,839)
- Compounding frequency (annual vs monthly would change formula)

### Question 3: Disability Insurance - Own Occupation vs Any Occupation (C.20)

**Topic**: C.20 Disability income insurance - Risk Management & Insurance domain (11% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Tom (surgeon, $400k/year) shopping for disability insurance.
- Option A: "Own Occupation" - $5k/year premium, $15k/month benefit
- Option B: "Any Occupation" - $2.5k/year premium, $15k/month benefit
- Scenario: Hand injury prevents surgery, but can work as consultant earning $100k/year
- Question: Which policy pays?

**Student's Answer**:
- "Option A will reimburse but Option B will not because he's not qualified for the any occupation, he still can do something"
- "I think Option 1 is better"
- ✓ CORRECT CONCLUSION - Option A pays, Option B doesn't

**Initial Understanding**:
- Correctly identified outcome
- Had terminology slightly mixed ("option 1 only covers all occupation") but understood the concept

**Explanation Given**:

**Own Occupation Policy**:
- Pays if cannot perform YOUR specific occupation
- Even if can work elsewhere
- More expensive ($5k vs $2.5k)
- Best for high-income specialists (surgeons, dentists, lawyers)
- Tom gets benefits + consultant income

**Any Occupation Policy**:
- Only pays if cannot perform ANY reasonable occupation
- Harder to qualify for benefits
- Cheaper premium
- Tom can work as consultant → no benefits

**Modified Own Occupation** (introduced):
- Middle ground option
- Pays if can't do your job AND aren't working elsewhere
- Benefits stop if work elsewhere

**Premium Difference**:
- Own Occupation costs 2x more because easier to qualify for benefits

**Understanding Level**: VERY GOOD - Grasped the outcome correctly, just needed terminology clarification on which is "own" vs "any" occupation.

**Key Learning**: Own Occupation = better coverage, more expensive, recommended for professionals with specialized skills.

## Notes

Session 5 - Student is 20 days from exam. Focused on testing NEW topics from exam outline that haven't been covered. Student performed excellently on all 3 tests:
- RMD rules: Perfect understanding
- Time value of money: Already had strong foundation
- Disability insurance: Grasped concept quickly

Student requested to stop session to handle other tasks. Progress saved. Next session should continue testing uncovered topics or dive deep into business taxation (high-priority gap).

**Repository Reorganization Completed**: Consolidated all progress tracking to single cfp-exam-coverage-map.md file for easier maintenance.
