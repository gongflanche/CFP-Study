## Questions Asked

### Question 1: Traditional IRA Contribution Limits (Practice Problem)

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about Sharon (age 58, receiving pension, working part-time)

**Problem Details**:
- Sharon: single, age 58
- Retired 2 years ago, receiving $600/month ($7,200/year) pension from qualified pension plan
- New position at CPA firm with no pension plan
- Will earn $5,000/year from CPA firm
- Question: Maximum deductible contribution to traditional IRA for 2024?

**Student's Answer**: Selected B) $0 (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: A) $5,000

**Initial Understanding**: Student was confused about:
- Whether having an existing pension disqualifies IRA contributions
- What qualifies someone to contribute to traditional IRA
- Unclear on earned income vs. pension income distinction

**Explanation Given**:
Covered the core rule: Must have earned income to contribute to IRA. Maximum contribution is lesser of:
1. Earned income for the year
2. IRA limit ($7,000 + $1,000 catch-up for age 50+ = $8,000 in 2024)

Key distinction: Wages/salaries = earned income. Pension/Social Security/investments = NOT earned income.

For Sharon: $5,000 wages (earned) vs $7,200 pension (doesn't count). Max = lesser of $5,000 or $8,000 = $5,000.

**Comprehension Check Questions**:
1. If Sharon earned $10,000, what would max contribution be?
   - Student's answer: $8,000 ✓ CORRECT
   - Reasoning: Earned income ($10,000) exceeds limit ($8,000), so limit wins

2. If Sharon had no job and only pension, could she contribute to IRA?
   - Student's answer: $0 ✓ CORRECT
   - Reasoning: No earned income = no IRA contribution

**Understanding Level**: STRONG - Student correctly applied the "lesser of" rule and understood pension doesn't count as earned income

**Follow-up - Active Participant Rules**:

Student revealed the actual source of confusion: Thought that if new employer had a 401(k), she couldn't deduct IRA contribution - this is why they originally selected $0.

Covered key distinction:
- Contributing to IRA (only needs earned income)
- vs. Deducting IRA contribution (affected by active participant status + income limits)

Active participant phase-out for 2024 (single): $77k-$87k
- Under $77k = full deduction
- Over $87k = no deduction
- But can ALWAYS contribute if have earned income

**Comprehension Check 3**: If Sharon earned $90,000 AND firm had 401(k):
a) Can she contribute to IRA?
b) Can she deduct it?

Student's answers:
- a) Yes, can contribute ✓ CORRECT
- b) No, cannot deduct ✓ CORRECT (income exceeds $87k phase-out)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student now clearly understands contribute vs. deduct distinction

**Follow-up**: Introduced Roth IRA as alternative when traditional IRA isn't deductible

## Key Concepts Covered

**Retirement Accounts:**
- **Traditional IRA Contribution Eligibility**: Must have earned income; max is lesser of earned income or limit ($7k + $1k catch-up)
- **Earned Income Definition**: Wages/salary count; pension/Social Security/investment income don't count
- **Active Participant Rules**: Having employer retirement plan doesn't prevent contribution, only affects deductibility
- **Deduction Phase-out (2024, single, active participant)**: $77k-$87k
- **Roth IRA Alternative**: Better than non-deductible traditional IRA when can't deduct (tax-free vs tax-deferred growth)

**Retirement Plan Classifications:**
- **Classification System #1 - DC vs DB**: Based on what's defined and who bears investment risk
  - Defined Contribution: Contribution is known, benefit unknown. Employee bears investment risk.
  - Defined Benefit: Benefit is promised, contribution varies. Employer bears investment risk.
- **Classification System #2 - Pension vs Profit-Sharing**: Based on contribution requirements
  - Pension Plans: Mandatory, fixed contributions
  - Profit-Sharing Plans: Discretionary, flexible contributions
- **Tricky Plans**:
  - Cash Balance Plan: DB (despite showing account balance, employer bears all investment risk)
  - Target Benefit Plan: DC (targets a benefit but doesn't guarantee it)
  - Money Purchase Pension: DC plan with mandatory contributions (pension type)

**Investment Risk:**
- **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: = correlation². Represents % of systematic risk
- **Systematic Risk**: Market risk, cannot be diversified away. Measured by R²
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Company-specific risk, can be diversified away. Formula: 1 - R²
- **Correlation = 1.0**: Pure market exposure (like index funds), 100% systematic risk, 0% unsystematic
- **Higher correlation**: More systematic risk, less diversification benefit

**Short Selling & Options:**
- **Short Selling Stock**: Borrow shares → Sell → Buy back lower → Return shares. Unlimited risk, no expiration
- **Buying Put Options**: Limited risk (premium only), has expiration, better for timing-specific bearish bets
- **When to use Short Selling**: Bearish with uncertain timeline (can hold indefinitely)
- **When to use Puts**: Bearish with timing confidence (short-term bets)
- **Key difference**: Short selling = unlimited losses; Put options = limited loss to premium

**Nondiscrimination Testing:**
- **HCE Definition**: 5% owner OR compensation > $155,000 (2024)
- **Ratio Percentage Test**: (% non-HCEs covered) ÷ (% HCEs covered) ≥ 70%
- **Average Benefits Test**: (Avg non-HCE benefit) ÷ (Avg HCE benefit) ≥ 70%
- **Purpose**: Ensure qualified plans don't unfairly favor highly compensated employees

**Estate Planning & Probate:**
- **Probate Process**: Court-supervised collection of assets, payment of debts, distribution per will/state law
- **Goes Through Probate**: Solely-owned property, tenants in common property, life insurance payable to estate
- **Avoids Probate**: Beneficiary designations (to persons), JTWROS, trusts, TOD/POD accounts
- **Life Insurance Beneficiaries**:
  - To person → Avoids probate
  - To estate → Goes through probate (used for estate liquidity, by mistake, or when no close family)
- **JTWROS (Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship)**: Passes automatically to surviving owner, avoids probate
- **Tenants in Common**: Your share goes through probate (no automatic transfer to co-owner)

**Tax Planning:**
- **QCD (Qualified Charitable Distribution)**: Direct IRA → charity transfer, age 70½+, excludes from income (better than withdrawal + deduction)
- **Capital Gains Tax Rates**: ST = ordinary rates; LT = 0%/15%/20% based on bracket
- **Capital Loss Netting**: Net ST, net LT, then net together; result keeps character of larger category
- **Tax Doctrines**:
  - Step Transaction: IRS collapses pre-planned multiple steps into one transaction
  - Constructive Receipt: Income taxable when available, even if not received
  - Assignment of Income: Income taxed to earner, can't avoid by assigning
  - Tax-Deferred Exchange: 1031 like-kind exchanges
- **Passive Activity Losses**:
  - Rental losses = passive; can only offset passive income
  - Exception: Active participants can deduct $25k (phases out $100k-$150k AGI)
  - Disposition rule: ALL suspended losses released when property sold
- **Business Start-Up Costs**: $5k deductible Year 1, excess amortized over 15 years
- **Section 179**: Expense entire equipment cost in Year 1 (subject to limits)
- **Mid-Quarter Convention**: Required if >40% of equipment purchased in Q4

### Question 2: Systematic vs Unsystematic Risk Calculation

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about Portfolio A with standard deviation 12%, market SD 16%, correlation 0.5. What % is unsystematic risk?

**Student's Answer**: Selected A) 50% (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: C) 75%

**Initial Understanding**:
- Good conceptual understanding: knows systematic vs unsystematic risk definitions
- Understood diversification reduces unsystematic risk
- Did NOT know the mathematical calculation
- Correctly identified that standard deviations were irrelevant information

**Explanation Given**:
Formula for unsystematic risk:
1. Calculate R² = (correlation coefficient)²
2. R² = systematic risk %
3. Unsystematic risk = 1 - R²

For this problem:
- R² = 0.5² = 0.25 (25% systematic)
- Unsystematic = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 (75%)

Student likely chose 50% by using correlation directly instead of squaring it.

**Comprehension Check Questions**:

1. If correlation = 0.80, what % is unsystematic risk?
   - Student's answer: 1 - 0.8² = 0.36 or 36% ✓ CORRECT
   - Applied formula perfectly

2. If correlation = 1.0, what % is unsystematic risk, and what does this mean practically?
   - Student's answer: 0% ✓ CORRECT
   - Explanation: "Like investing the whole market, literally a duplicate of S&P 500" ✓ EXCELLENT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from zero knowledge of the formula to complete mastery in minutes. Strong conceptual and mathematical understanding.

**Key Insight**: Student asked great clarifying question about whether standard deviations mattered - correctly identified they were red herrings for this specific question.

---

### Question 3: Retirement Plan Classifications

**Student's Question**: Conceptual discussion - "I remember there are two ways of splitting retirement plans: defined contribution vs defined benefit, and profit sharing vs pension. Is this correct?"

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew there were two classification systems
- Understood defined benefit correctly (benefit amount is promised)
- MISUNDERSTOOD defined contribution: thought it meant employer could choose whether to contribute
- Correctly suspected profit sharing vs pension was a separate classification

**Explanation Given**:

**Classification System #1: Defined Contribution vs Defined Benefit**
- DC: Contribution amount is known, benefit amount is unknown (depends on investment performance)
- DB: Benefit amount is promised, contribution amount varies (whatever is needed to fund the promise)
- Key: Who bears investment risk? DC = employee, DB = employer

**Classification System #2: Pension Plans vs Profit-Sharing Plans**
- Pension Plans: Mandatory, fixed contribution requirements
- Profit-Sharing Plans: Discretionary/flexible contributions

**Tricky Plans Discussed**:
- **Cash Balance Plan**: LOOKS like DC (shows account balance) but is actually DB (employer bears investment risk, promises specific credits/returns)
- **Target Benefit Plan**: DC plan that aims for a target benefit but doesn't guarantee it
- **Money Purchase Pension Plan**: DC plan with mandatory contributions (pension type, but DC classification)

**Comprehension Checks**:

1. Classification of 401(k):
   - System #1: Defined Contribution ✓
   - System #2: Profit-Sharing ✓

2. Why is Cash Balance Plan defined benefit?
   - Student's answer: "Employer takes all the risk. They credit you 5% no matter the market result. The money showing makes you feel happy but it's actually a defined benefit" ✓ EXCELLENT

3. Why is Target Benefit Plan defined contribution?
   - Student's answer: "It's called target benefit, not defined benefit. It gives guidance about contributions to reach the goal, but if investments underperform, you don't get the target" ✓ CORRECT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student had the framework mostly correct and quickly grasped the nuances of tricky plans like Cash Balance and Target Benefit.

---

### Question 4: Short Selling vs Options (Terminology Clarification)

**Student's Question**: Practice problem about short selling - got it right (D: benefit from decline) but wanted to clarify terminology

**Initial Understanding**:
- Strong understanding of options (call vs put, long vs short positions)
- **CONFUSION**: Thought "short selling" was related to options terminology
- Thought "sell = short" in options context
- Did not understand mechanics of short selling stock

**Explanation Given**:

**Short Selling Stock (NOT options):**
1. Borrow shares from broker
2. Sell borrowed shares at current price
3. Wait for price to drop
4. Buy back shares at lower price
5. Return shares to broker
6. Profit = sell price - buy price

**Key characteristics:**
- Unlimited loss potential (stock can rise infinitely)
- No expiration date (can hold indefinitely)
- Costs: borrowing fees, dividends, margin requirements
- No premium to enter position

**Buying Put Options (comparison):**
- Limited loss (only premium paid)
- Has expiration date (time decay)
- Better for short-term bearish bets with certain timing
- Pay premium upfront

**Common Misconception Corrected:**
Student initially thought when you buy a put and stock rises, you lose both the price difference AND premium.
✗ Wrong: Loss = $50 + $2 premium
✓ Correct: Loss = ONLY $2 premium (maximum loss is always just the premium)

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. If you short sell at $50 and stock rises to $100, what's your loss?
   - Student's answer: $50 loss ✓ CORRECT

2. If you buy a put for $2 premium and stock rises to $100, what's your loss?
   - Student's initial answer: $52 ✗ INCORRECT
   - After correction: Understood max loss is only $2 premium ✓

3. Why would someone short sell instead of buying puts?
   - Student initially didn't know
   - After explanation: "Short selling is for when you don't have a date confidence" ✓ EXCELLENT INSIGHT

4. When would you use puts vs short selling for bearish bet?
   - Student's answer: "Long put when you have a date confidence, short selling when you don't have date confidence" ✓ PERFECT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from confusing short selling with options terminology to fully understanding the mechanics, risk profiles, and appropriate use cases for each strategy.

**Key Insight**: Student made excellent connection that short selling = indefinite timeline, puts = specific timeline/timing confidence.

---

### Question 5: Nondiscrimination Testing - Ratio Percentage Test

**Student's Question**: Beauty Co. pension plan problem - 20 HCEs (16 covered), 180 non-HCEs (125 covered). HCE avg benefit 8%, non-HCE avg benefit 3%.

**Student's Answer**: Selected B) Plan doesn't meet ratio percentage test but meets average benefits test (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: C) Plan meets ratio percentage test

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew nondiscrimination testing exists for qualified plans
- Knew definition of HCE (5% owner or $155k+ salary)
- Knew there are Ratio Percentage Test and Average Benefits Test
- **Did NOT remember the specific formulas or calculations**
- Found problem "very hard" due to all the numbers

**Explanation Given**:

**Ratio Percentage Test Formula:**
1. Calculate % HCEs covered
2. Calculate % non-HCEs covered
3. Divide: (non-HCE %) ÷ (HCE %)
4. Must be ≥ 70% to pass

**Average Benefits Test Formula:**
- (Average non-HCE benefit) ÷ (Average HCE benefit) ≥ 70%

**Student's Calculation (done independently):**
- HCE coverage: 16/20 = 80% ✓
- Non-HCE coverage: 125/180 = 69.5% ✓
- Ratio: 69.5/80 = 87% ✓
- Conclusion: 87% ≥ 70%, so PASSES ✓ PERFECT

Average Benefits check:
- 3% ÷ 8% = 37.5%
- 37.5% < 70%, so FAILS

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Once shown the formula structure, student calculated correctly and understood immediately. The issue was not remembering the specific formulas, not the ability to apply them.

**Key Insight**: Student selected answer saying "doesn't pass" even though their own math proved it passes - suggests lack of confidence in their calculations or test anxiety.

### Question 6: Probate Estate - Life Insurance Payable to Estate

**Student's Question**: What property is included in probate estate? Problem included: (1) solely-owned securities, (2) tenants in common, (3) life insurance payable to estate, (4) JTWROS condo with spouse.

**Student's Answer**: Selected C) 1 and 2 (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: A) 1, 2, and 3

**Initial Understanding**:
- Good basic understanding: probate is for property without clear beneficiary
- Correctly identified physical property (houses) often goes through probate
- Correctly understood bank accounts/stocks with beneficiaries avoid probate
- **CONFUSION**: Didn't understand "life insurance payable to estate" concept
- Key question: "What does it mean life insurance payable to decedent's estate? Can I be the beneficiary? Can my estate be the beneficiary?"

**Explanation Given**:

**Probate Process:**
- Court-supervised process to collect assets, pay debts, distribute remainder
- Goes through probate: Solely-owned property, tenants in common
- Avoids probate: Beneficiary designations, JTWROS, trusts, TOD/POD accounts

**Life Insurance Beneficiaries:**
- Normal: Beneficiary = person (spouse, kids) → Avoids probate
- Special case: Beneficiary = "Estate" → GOES THROUGH PROBATE
- Cannot name yourself as beneficiary (you're dead when it pays)
- Can name estate as beneficiary (though usually not ideal)

**Why name estate as beneficiary?**
1. **Intentional - Estate liquidity**: Pay estate taxes/debts when assets are illiquid (e.g., $10M business, $3M tax bill, need insurance cash to avoid fire sale)
2. **By mistake**: Named beneficiary died, forgot to update, defaults to estate
3. **No close family**: Easier to distribute to multiple distant relatives through will

**For CFP Exam:**
- Life insurance → person = Avoids probate
- Life insurance → estate = Goes through probate

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student understood the concept once explained. The confusion was about the practical application of naming estate as beneficiary, not the probate mechanics.

**Key Insight**: Student asked excellent practical question: "Who does that for what?" Shows desire to understand real-world application, not just memorize rules.

### Question 7: Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD) Eligibility Age

**Student's Question**: Client turned 70, when first eligible for QCD? Options: Immediately, After 70.5, At 72, Once starting RMDs

**Student's Answer**: After 70.5 ✓ CORRECT

**Initial Understanding**:
- Some confusion about QCD concept and tax treatment
- Thought: "Move money from IRA to charity, no tax, no deduction - just move money"
- Wasn't sure about the benefit/advantage
- Understood age requirement is 70.5

**Explanation Given**:

**Normal IRA Withdrawal + Donation:**
- Withdraw $10k from IRA → Pay income tax
- Donate $10k to charity → Get charitable deduction
- Net: They cancel out (if itemize)

**QCD (Better Way):**
- Money goes directly IRA → Charity
- **Does NOT show up as taxable income** (key benefit!)
- No charitable deduction (don't need it - already excluded from income)
- Benefits: Lower AGI, avoid Medicare surcharges, works with standard deduction, counts toward RMD

**Key Rules:**
- QCD eligibility: Age 70½
- RMD starts: Age 73 (or 75 for born 1960+)
- Can do QCDs BEFORE RMDs are required
- QCD annual limit: $105,000 (2024)

**Age 70½ Calculation:**
- 70 years + 6 months
- Example: Born Jan 15, 1955 → Turn 70 Jan 15, 2025 → QCD eligible July 15, 2025

**Comprehension Check:**
"Why is QCD better than withdraw + donate?"
- Student's answer: "It doesn't count as income" ✓ CORRECT

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Initially confused about tax treatment but quickly grasped the AGI benefit once explained.

### Question 8: Capital Gains/Losses Netting and Tax Calculation

**Student's Question**: Client has ST gains $500, ST losses $800, LT gains $1,500, LT losses $800. In 24% bracket. What's tax liability?

**Student's Answer**: Not specified, but calculated $400 × 24% = $96 (INCORRECT)
**Correct Answer**: B) $60

**Initial Understanding**:
- **EXCELLENT netting calculation**:
  - ST: $500 - $800 = -$300 loss ✓
  - LT: $1,500 - $800 = $700 gain ✓
  - Combined: -$300 + $700 = $400 long-term gain ✓
- Understood result keeps long-term character ✓
- **ERROR**: Applied 24% ordinary rate to long-term gain
- Calculation: $400 × 24% = $96 ✗

**Explanation Given**:

**Tax Rate Rules:**
- Short-term capital gains = Ordinary income tax rates
- Long-term capital gains = Preferential rates: 0%, 15%, or 20%

**LTCG Tax Brackets (2024, Single):**
- 10%, 12% ordinary bracket → 0% LTCG
- 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% ordinary bracket → **15% LTCG**
- 37% ordinary bracket → 20% LTCG

**Correct Calculation:**
- $400 (long-term gain) × 15% = $60

**Comprehension Check:**
"If the final result was $400 short-term gain, what would tax be?"
- Student's answer: "24%" ✓ CORRECT (would be $96)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT on netting mechanics, but forgot the preferential rate for LTCG. Corrected immediately when reminded.

**Key Gap**: Didn't recall that long-term capital gains get preferential rates (15% for 24% bracket, not 24%).

---

### Question 9: Tax Doctrines - Step Transaction

**Student's Question**: "A series of intermediate transactions may be collapsed and treated as a single transaction" - which doctrine?

**Student's Answer**: Step transaction ✓ CORRECT

**Initial Understanding**:
- No knowledge of any of these tax doctrines
- Didn't understand what "collapsing transactions" meant
- Knew tax-deferred exchange (1031) but not the others

**Explanation Given**:

**Four Tax Doctrines:**
1. **Step Transaction Doctrine**: IRS collapses multiple pre-planned steps into one transaction based on economic substance
2. **Constructive Receipt**: Income is taxable when available, even if not physically received
3. **Tax-Deferred Exchange**: 1031 like-kind exchanges (legitimate tax benefit)
4. **Assignment of Income**: Income taxed to earner, can't avoid by assigning to someone else

**Example of Step Transaction:**
- Dad sells stock to friend for $100k
- Friend gives daughter $100k as gift
- Daughter buys stock from friend
- IRS: "This is really just Dad gifting to daughter" (collapses all steps)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from zero knowledge to correctly identifying the doctrine after examples.

### Question 10: Business Start-Up & Depreciation (Section 179, MACRS, Mid-Quarter Convention)

**Student's Question**: Bakery opened November, bought $60k equipment, $5k legal fees. Which statement is correct?

**Student's Answer**: Not specified - student felt overwhelmed by complexity

**Initial Understanding**:
- "Too many things, don't know how to start"
- Unfamiliar with: Mid-quarter convention, Section 179, start-up cost rules, Section 1245 recapture

**Explanation Given** (High-level overview):

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Start-up costs**: $5k deductible Year 1, excess amortized over 15 years
2. **Section 179**: Expense entire equipment cost in Year 1 (vs. spreading depreciation)
3. **Mid-quarter convention**: If >40% equipment purchased in Q4, must use mid-quarter for MACRS
4. **Section 1245 recapture**: Depreciation/179 deductions recaptured as ordinary income on sale

**Correct Answer**: A) Must use mid-quarter convention (100% purchased in Q4 > 40% threshold)

**Understanding Level**: PARTIAL - Student was tired and concepts were complex. Provided overview but didn't verify comprehension.

**Note**: This topic needs more review when student is fresh - business taxation is a significant exam area.

---

### Question 11: Passive Activity Loss Rules - Disposition/Sale

**Student's Question**: Rental property sold in current year. Current year loss $7k, prior suspended losses $29k. AGI $300k. What's deductible?

**Student's Answer**: Not initially specified

**Correct Answer**: D) $36,000 (all suspended losses released)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew about passive loss rules and $25k exception for active participation
- Knew it depends on income level (lower income needed)
- Didn't remember specific AGI thresholds
- Confused about what happens when property is sold
- Didn't know about "unallowed passive losses" being released

**Explanation Given**:

**Normal Passive Loss Rules (While Owning):**
- Rental losses = passive losses (can only offset passive income)
- Exception: Active participants can deduct up to $25k against ordinary income
- AGI phase-out: $100k-$150k
- AGI > $150k → $0 deduction allowed (losses suspended)

**Disposition Rule (When Selling):**
- When you SELL passive activity in fully taxable transaction
- ALL suspended passive losses are RELEASED and become deductible
- "Dam breaks" - all accumulated losses flood out

**This Problem:**
- Prior suspended: $29,000
- Current year: $7,000 (also suspended due to high AGI)
- Property SOLD → Release all: $29k + $7k = $36,000 deductible

**Comprehension Check:**
"If property NOT sold this year, how much deductible?"
- Student's answer: "$0" ✓ CORRECT (all $36k would remain suspended)

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Understood the concept once explained. The "release on disposition" rule was new but made sense.

## Notes
First session - student is working through practice problems and asking for help on questions they got wrong. Good approach to learning! Student learns well through the Socratic method and quickly grasped both the contribute vs. deduct distinction and the R-squared formula once explained clearly. Asks excellent clarifying questions. Ready for next question.
