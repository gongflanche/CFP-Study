## Practice Problems Completed

### Question 1: LTD Integration with Own vs Any Occupation (C.20)

**Topic**: C.20 Disability income insurance - Risk Management domain (11% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Client's long-term disability policy requires integration with Social Security if policy pays for being unable to perform any work. Client becomes disabled, unable to perform duties of their job. Policy max: $3,000/month, SS will pay $1,500/month. How much total monthly benefits?

**Options**:
- A) $0
- B) $1,500 ✓
- C) $3,000
- D) $4,500

**Student's Initial Reaction**: [No immediate answer provided]

**Correct Answer**: **B) $1,500**

**Key Concept Explained**:

**The Trap**: Question tests disability DEFINITION, not integration math

**Policy definition**: "Unable to perform **ANY** work" = **Any Occupation**
**Client's disability**: "Unable to perform duties of **THEIR** job" = **Own Occupation disability**

**Do these match?** ❌ NO!

**Disability Definition Comparison**:

| Definition | Meaning | Qualify? |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Any Occupation** | Cannot do ANY reasonable job | Very restrictive |
| **Own Occupation** | Cannot do YOUR specific job | More generous |

**Client's situation**:
- Can't do their specific job ✓
- But might be able to work elsewhere
- Doesn't meet "any occupation" definition ❌

**Benefits Received**:
- Group LTD policy: **$0** (doesn't meet definition)
- Social Security: **$1,500** (given as fact)
- **Total: $1,500**

**Why integration doesn't matter**: Policy isn't paying at all! Integration only applies when BOTH are paying.

**If policy had paid**:
- Own benefit: $3,000
- SS benefit: $1,500
- Integration would reduce total to $3,000
- But here, policy doesn't pay because client doesn't qualify

**Key Learning**:
- Read disability definition carefully!
- Own Occupation ≠ Any Occupation
- "Can't do my job" ≠ "Can't do any job"
- Client falls in gap: disabled for their job, but not for "any" job

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student found it "interesting" after explanation

### Question 2: Business Succession Planning with Special Needs (Multiple Topics)

**Topics**: F.53 Business succession planning, G.64 Special needs planning, C.24 Business owner insurance

**Problem Given**: Married client, sole owner of small business (FMV $1M, rapidly increasing). Other assets $600K joint. Two adult children - spouse and children NOT capable/inclined to run business. One child is mentally incapacitated. Most appropriate ownership and succession planning?

**Options**:
- A) C corp + funded buy-sell agreement with key employee + special needs trust ✓
- B) FLP with client as 1% GP, spouse/children as 33% LPs
- C) S corp + testamentary trust for spouse and children
- D) Special needs trust with prearranged sale to competitor

**Student's Response**: [No initial answer provided]

**Correct Answer**: **A) C corporation + funded buy-sell agreement with key employee + special needs trust**

**Client's Needs Analysis**:

1. **Business succession** - family can't/won't run it
2. **Liquidity** for family when client dies
3. **Special needs planning** for incapacitated child
4. **Tax efficiency**

**Why Option A is Correct**:

**C corporation:**
- Allows non-family ownership (key employee can be shareholder)
- Flexible for sale to outsider

**Funded buy-sell agreement with key employee:**
- ✅ Solves succession problem!
- Family doesn't run business → key employee buys it
- "Funded" = life insurance on client's life pays $1M
- Insurance proceeds buy business from estate
- Provides liquidity to family
- Business continues under capable management

**Special needs trust (SNT):**
- ✅ Solves incapacitated child problem!
- Preserves government benefits (SSI, Medicaid)
- Provides supplemental care
- Protects child's inheritance

**This addresses BOTH critical issues!**

**Why Option B Fails (FLP)**:
- Family doesn't WANT to own/run business!
- FLP forces ownership on unwilling/incapable family
- Who manages the business? Family can't!
- No exit strategy/liquidity
- Doesn't specifically address special needs child

**When FLP works**: Family WANTS to stay involved, multi-generational business

**Why Option C Fails (S corp + testamentary trust)**:
- Who runs the business? Family can't!
- Testamentary trust only takes effect at death
- Doesn't provide management succession
- Doesn't specifically preserve government benefits for special needs child

**Why Option D Fails (SNT with sale)**:
- Structurally confused - SNT is for beneficiary care, not business ownership
- Can't hold operating business as primary asset
- Mixing business ownership with SNT creates problems

**Key Concepts**:

**Business Succession Planning (F.53)**:
- Buy-sell agreements: Cross-purchase, entity purchase, funded vs unfunded
- When family CAN'T/WON'T run business → sell to key employee or third party
- When family WANTS to continue → FLP, voting/non-voting stock, GRAT

**Special Needs Planning (G.64)**:
- Special needs trust preserves government benefits
- First-party vs third-party SNT
- Critical for disabled beneficiaries with inheritance

**The Matching Principle**: Can you match the tools to the specific client situation?
- Wrong: Using FLP when family doesn't want ownership
- Right: Using buy-sell when family can't manage business

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood the logic after explanation

### Question 3: Insurable Interest - Family Relationships (C.17)

**Topic**: C.17 Principles of risk and insurance - Risk Management domain (11% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Which is an example of insurable interest?
- A) Mother purchasing life insurance on adult child ✓
- B) Bank purchasing policy on building for which they issued a loan
- C) Business purchasing life insurance on non-key employee
- D) Manufacturer purchasing policy on warehouse they lease

**Student's Question**: "I don't know why B is not chosen"

**Correct Answer**: **A) Mother purchasing life insurance on adult child**

**What is Insurable Interest?**
- You must have financial or emotional stake in insured's life/property continuing to exist
- You would suffer legitimate loss if person dies or property is destroyed
- Prevents insurance from becoming gambling or creating incentive for harm

**Analysis of Each Option**:

**Option A - Mother on Adult Child: ✅ VALID**
- Family relationships create automatic insurable interest
- Parents have insurable interest in children (regardless of age)
- Also valid: Children on parents, spouses on each other, siblings
- Emotional bond + potential financial support
- **Clearest textbook example**

**Option B - Bank on Building They Financed: ❌ NOT VALID**

**The critical distinction**:
- "Issued a loan FOR a building" ≠ "Holds a MORTGAGE ON a building"

**Two scenarios**:

| Scenario | Insurable Interest? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Bank holds MORTGAGE (secured creditor) | ✅ YES - building is collateral |
| Bank issued loan USED to buy building (unsecured) | ❌ NO - building not collateral |

**Option B problems**:
1. Wording "for which they issued a loan" is vague - doesn't state building is collateral
2. Bank doesn't OWN the building (borrower does)
3. Without explicit security interest (mortgage/lien), no insurable interest
4. Even with mortgage, OWNER (not bank) typically purchases property insurance

**Property insurance insurable interest requires**:
- Ownership interest (you own it), OR
- Security interest (you hold mortgage/lien on it)

**Option C - Business on Non-Key Employee: ❌ NOT VALID**

| Employee Type | Insurable Interest? | Why? |
|---------------|---------------------|------|
| Key employee | ✅ YES | Death causes significant financial loss |
| Non-key employee | ❌ NO | Death causes normal loss, easily replaced |

**Key employee examples**: CEO, top salesperson, specialized expert
**Non-key employee**: Easily replaceable, no special financial loss

**Option D - Lessee on Leased Warehouse: ❌ NOT VALID**

**Property insurance rules**:
- Owner/Landlord: ✅ Insurable interest in building structure
- Tenant/Lessee: ❌ NO interest in building, ✅ YES interest in their contents

**Why tenant lacks interest**:
- Doesn't own the building
- Owner responsible for insuring structure
- Tenant only insures contents and liability

**The Takeaway**:
- Family relationships = clearest, automatic insurable interest
- Lending money FOR something ≠ having security interest IN that thing
- Need ownership OR mortgage/lien for property insurable interest

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student questioned the distinction, understood after clarification

### Question 4: Life Insurance Annuity Settlement Option Taxation (C.23)

**Topic**: C.23 Life insurance - Settlement options and taxation

**Problem Given**: Freda's brother Cleve died April 1. Freda is beneficiary of $100,000 life insurance. She elected annuity of $600/month for 45 years, beginning May 1. Her life expectancy is 45 years. Cleve had $50,000 basis in policy. What amount of annuity must Freda include in this year's taxable gross income?

**Options**:
- A) $0
- B) $1,481
- C) $3,319 ✓
- D) $4,059

**Student's Response**: [No initial answer provided]

**Correct Answer**: **C) $3,319**

**Facts Summary**:
- Death benefit: $100,000
- Cleve's basis: $50,000 (distractor!)
- Annuity: $600/month for 45 years
- This year's payments: May-December = 8 months = $4,800 total

**Life Insurance Death Benefit Tax Rules**:
- Death benefits are INCOME TAX-FREE (IRC §101)
- BUT when taken as annuity instead of lump sum:
  - The $100,000 death benefit portion = tax-free
  - Interest earned while insurance company holds money = TAXABLE

**The Calculation**:

**Step 1: Total Expected Payments**
- $600/month × 12 months × 45 years = **$324,000**

**Step 2: Tax-Free vs Taxable Portions**
- Investment in contract (tax-free) = **$100,000** (the death benefit)
- Total payments = $324,000
- Taxable portion (interest) = $324,000 - $100,000 = **$224,000**

**Step 3: Exclusion Ratio**
- Exclusion ratio = Tax-free amount / Total expected return
- = $100,000 / $324,000 = **0.308642** (30.86%)

This means:
- 30.86% of each payment is tax-free (return of death benefit)
- 69.14% of each payment is taxable (interest)

**Step 4: Each Monthly Payment**
- Tax-free portion: $600 × 0.308642 = $185.19
- Taxable portion: $600 × 0.691358 = **$414.81**

**Step 5: This Year's Taxable Amount**
- 8 months of payments (May-December)
- Taxable: $414.81 × 8 = **$3,318.52**
- Rounded: **$3,319**

**Formula Summary**:
```
Total annuity = $600 × 12 × 45 = $324,000
Tax-free (death benefit) = $100,000
Taxable (interest) = $224,000

Exclusion ratio = $100,000 / $324,000 = 30.86%

Each $600 payment:
├─ Tax-free (30.86%): $185.19
└─ Taxable (69.14%): $414.81

This year (8 months):
Taxable = $414.81 × 8 = $3,319
```

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong**:
- **$0**: Wrong - interest earned is taxable even though death benefit is tax-free
- **$1,481**: This is the tax-FREE portion ($185.19 × 8) - common trap!
- **$4,059**: Doesn't match any logical calculation
- **$4,800**: Would be if 100% taxable (ignoring tax-free death benefit)

**What About Cleve's $50,000 Basis?**
- **This is a DISTRACTOR!**
- Basis matters for policy surrenders during life
- At death, full death benefit is tax-free regardless of basis
- For Freda's annuity, "investment in contract" is the $100,000 death benefit, not Cleve's basis

**Key Learning Points**:
1. Lump sum death benefit = 100% tax-free
2. Annuity payout = Death benefit portion tax-free, interest portion taxable
3. Use exclusion ratio to split each payment
4. Don't confuse owner's basis with beneficiary's tax treatment

### Question 5: Social Security Spousal Benefits with Early Filing (F.45)

**Topic**: F.45 Social Security and Medicare - Retirement Planning domain (18% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Client receiving SS benefits of $3,888/month. Her husband files for SS. What will be his monthly benefit?
- Wife: 68 years old, FRA 67, PIA $3,600, receiving $3,888
- Husband: 66 years old (filing now), FRA 67, PIA $1,500

**Options**:
- A) $1,400
- B) $1,500
- C) $1,680 ✓
- D) $1,944

**Student's Response**: [No initial answer provided]

**Correct Answer**: **C) $1,680**

**Understanding Wife's Current Benefit**:
- Receiving $3,888 but PIA is $3,600
- She's 68, FRA is 67 → filed 1 year AFTER FRA
- Delayed retirement credits: 8% per year past FRA
- $3,600 × 1.08 = **$3,888** ✓

**Husband's Benefit Calculation**:

**His Own Worker Benefit**:
- Filing at 66, which is 1 year before FRA (12 months early)
- Early filing reduction: 5/9 of 1% per month × 12 months = 6.67%
- His benefit: $1,500 × (1 - 0.0667) = $1,500 × 0.9333 = **$1,400**

**Spousal Benefit Eligibility**:
- Wife is receiving benefits ✓
- 50% of wife's PIA = 50% × $3,600 = $1,800
- Husband's PIA = $1,500
- Since $1,800 > $1,500, he's eligible for spousal supplement!

**Deemed Filing Rule** (post-2015):
- When you file before FRA, automatically deemed to file for spousal benefits too
- Can't strategically delay spousal benefits separately

**Spousal Supplement Calculation**:
- Base: 50% of wife's PIA minus his own PIA
- Excess: $1,800 - $1,500 = **$300**
- This $300 is ALSO reduced for early filing
- Spousal reduction: 25/36 of 1% per month × 12 months = 8.33%
- Reduced supplement: $300 × (1 - 0.0833) = $300 × 0.9167 = **$275**

**Total Monthly Benefit**:
- Own benefit: $1,400
- Spousal supplement: $275
- **Total: $1,675 ≈ $1,680** (rounding)

**Formula Summary**:
```
Own reduced benefit:
$1,500 × (1 - 6.67%) = $1,400

Spousal supplement:
Excess = (50% × $3,600) - $1,500 = $300
Reduced = $300 × (1 - 8.33%) = $275

Total = $1,400 + $275 = $1,675 ≈ $1,680
```

**Early Filing Reduction Rates**:

| Benefit Type | Reduction Rate | 12 Months Early |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Own benefit | 5/9 of 1% per month | 6.67% |
| Spousal benefit | 25/36 of 1% per month | 8.33% |

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong**:
- **$1,400**: Only his own benefit, ignoring spousal supplement
- **$1,500**: His PIA at FRA (not filing early)
- **$1,944**: Doesn't match any logical calculation

**Key Learning**:
- Spousal benefits have different reduction rates than own benefits
- Deemed filing rule applies when filing before FRA
- Must calculate both own (reduced) + spousal supplement (also reduced)

### Question 6: Homeowners Insurance Special Limits (C.26)

**Topic**: C.26 Policy selection - Homeowners insurance sublimits

**Problem Given**: Family has HO-2 coverage, $200,000 dwelling, $100,000 personal property, $250 deductible. They have:
- Household furnishings: $75,000
- Jewelry: $10,000
- Fur coat: $4,000
- Coin collection: $3,000
- Computer at college dorm: $1,200

Which items need additional coverage?

**Options**:
- A) jewelry, fur coat, coin collection, and computer
- B) jewelry, fur coat, and coin collection only ✓
- C) jewelry, fur coat, and computer only
- D) jewelry only

**Student's Response**: [No initial answer provided]

**Correct Answer**: **B) jewelry, fur coat, and coin collection only**

**Standard HO Policy Special Limits** (sublimits regardless of Coverage C):

**1. Jewelry, Watches, Furs, Precious Stones:**
- Standard limit: **$1,500 total** (for theft)
- Their jewelry: $10,000
- Their fur coat: $4,000
- Total: $14,000
- Coverage gap: $14,000 - $1,500 = $12,500
- ✓ **NEED ADDITIONAL COVERAGE**

**2. Securities, Coins, Stamps, Collectibles:**
- Standard limit: **$200 total**
- Their coin collection: $3,000
- Coverage gap: $3,000 - $200 = $2,800
- ✓ **NEED ADDITIONAL COVERAGE**

**3. Property Away From Premises (Computer at College):**
- Standard coverage: **10% of Coverage C**
- Coverage C = $100,000
- 10% = $10,000 limit
- Their computer: $1,200
- $1,200 < $10,000 ✓ Fully covered
- ✗ **NO ADDITIONAL COVERAGE NEEDED**

**Analysis Summary**:

| Item | Value | Standard Limit | Need Additional? |
|------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Household furnishings | $75,000 | Full Coverage C | ✗ No |
| Jewelry | $10,000 | $1,500 | ✓ YES |
| Fur coat | $4,000 | $1,500 (shared with jewelry) | ✓ YES |
| Coin collection | $3,000 | $200 | ✓ YES |
| Computer (college) | $1,200 | $10,000 (10% off-premises) | ✗ No |

**Need Additional Coverage**:
1. ✓ Jewelry ($10,000 vs $1,500 limit)
2. ✓ Fur coat ($4,000 vs $1,500 limit - shared with jewelry)
3. ✓ Coin collection ($3,000 vs $200 limit)
4. ✗ Computer (covered under 10% off-premises rule)

**How to Fix Coverage Gaps**:
- **Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement (floater)**
- Add specific items with appraised values
- No deductible
- "All-risk" coverage (broader than named-peril)
- Total endorsement needed: $17,000

**Key Special Limits to Remember**:

| Property Type | Standard Limit |
|--------------|----------------|
| Jewelry, furs, gems | $1,500 |
| Securities, coins, stamps | $200 |
| Money, gold, silver | $200 |
| Firearms | $2,500 |
| Silverware | $2,500 |
| Watercraft | $1,500 |
| Business property | $2,500 |
| Off-premises | 10% of Coverage C |

**Critical Concept**: These sublimits apply regardless of total Coverage C amount! Even with $100,000 Coverage C, jewelry is still limited to $1,500 unless scheduled.

**Computer Exception**: Off-premises coverage (10% × $100,000 = $10,000) covers property temporarily away from home like student property at college, luggage while traveling, tools at work site.

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood the sublimit concept

## Key Concepts Mastered

### Disability Insurance (C.20)
- **Own Occupation**: Can't do YOUR specific job (easier to qualify)
- **Any Occupation**: Can't do ANY reasonable job (harder to qualify)
- **Integration only applies when policy pays** - no benefit = no integration calculation
- Client can fall in gap: disabled for their job but not for "any" job

### Business Succession (F.53, C.24, G.64)
- **Buy-sell agreements**: Key tool when family can't/won't run business
- **Funded buy-sell**: Life insurance provides liquidity
- **Special needs trusts**: Preserve government benefits (SSI, Medicaid)
- **Match tools to situation**: FLP for involved family, buy-sell for exit strategy

### Insurable Interest (C.17)
- **Family relationships**: Automatic insurable interest (parents/children, spouses, siblings)
- **Property**: Need ownership OR security interest (mortgage/lien)
- **Key employees**: Yes, Non-key employees: No
- **Tenants**: Interest in contents, NOT building structure

### Life Insurance Taxation (C.23)
- **Lump sum death benefit**: 100% tax-free
- **Annuity settlement**: Death benefit tax-free, interest taxable
- **Exclusion ratio** = Tax-free amount / Total expected payments
- Apply ratio to each payment to split tax-free vs taxable
- Owner's basis irrelevant to beneficiary's tax treatment at death

### Social Security Spousal Benefits (F.45)
- **Spousal benefit**: 50% of spouse's PIA (if higher than own)
- **Deemed filing**: Filing before FRA = automatic filing for all benefits
- **Reduction rates differ**: Own (5/9% per month) vs Spousal (25/36% per month)
- **Calculation**: Own reduced benefit + reduced spousal supplement

### Homeowners Special Limits (C.26)
- **Jewelry/furs**: $1,500 total limit
- **Coins/collectibles**: $200 total limit
- **Off-premises**: 10% of Coverage C
- **Sublimits apply regardless of total Coverage C**
- **Fix**: Scheduled personal property endorsement (floater)

## Additional Practice Problems

### Question 7: QPRT Mechanics (G.59)

**Topic**: G.59 Types, features, and taxation of trusts - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Which statement concerning a qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) is correct?
1. Grantor is permitted to create more than two QPRTs
2. Higher Applicable Federal Rate, lower value of retained interest ✓
3. Since grantor may not outlive term, gift doesn't occur until termination
4. Gift tax value of remainder interest increases as term of QPRT decreases ✓

**Student's Response**: [Worked through analysis]

**Correct Answer**: Most likely **Statement 4** (though Statement 2 is also technically correct)

**QPRT (Qualified Personal Residence Trust) Explained**:

**How it works**:
- Grantor transfers residence to trust
- Grantor retains right to live there for X years (the "term")
- After term, residence passes to beneficiaries
- Gift tax benefit: Gift value reduced because grantor retains use

**Statement Analysis**:

**Statement 1 - FALSE**: ❌
- Maximum of TWO QPRTs allowed
- One for principal residence, one for other residence (vacation home)
- Cannot create more than two

**Statement 2 - TRUE**: ✓
- Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) = Section 7520 discount rate
- Higher AFR → Higher discount rate → Lower present value
- Retained interest = PV of right to live in home for X years
- Higher AFR = Lower retained interest value
- **This is correct**

**Statement 3 - FALSE**: ❌
- Gift occurs at CREATION, not at termination
- Gift = present value of remainder interest calculated when QPRT created
- If grantor dies during term: Property comes back into estate (QPRT fails)
- If grantor survives term: Property successfully removed from estate
- Gift happens immediately regardless

**Statement 4 - TRUE**: ✓
- Formula: Gift = FMV of home - Value of retained interest
- **Longer term**: Grantor keeps property longer → Higher retained interest → Lower gift
- **Shorter term**: Grantor keeps property less time → Lower retained interest → Higher gift
- As term DECREASES → gift value INCREASES
- **This is the fundamental QPRT planning principle**
- **Most likely the intended answer**

**QPRT Planning Tradeoffs**:

**Shorter term**:
- ✓ Higher gift (uses more exemption now)
- ✓ Safer if might die during term
- ✓ Less time to survive

**Longer term**:
- ✓ Lower gift (saves exemption)
- ✗ Risky if die (property back in estate)
- ✗ Must survive longer

**QPRT Formula**: Gift = FMV of home - PV of retained interest

**What affects retained interest**:
1. Term length: Longer term = higher retained interest
2. AFR: Higher AFR = lower retained interest (discounting)

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Student analyzed both correct statements

### Question 8: SCIN for Shortened Life Expectancy (G.55)

**Topic**: G.55 Strategies to transfer property - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Ethan (70, widower, shortened life expectancy, $3M estate with $2.5M rental real estate). Objectives: minimize estate/gift taxes, provide cash flow for health care. Most appropriate technique?

**Options**:
- A) Self-Canceling Installment Note (SCIN) ✓
- B) Private annuity with children
- C) Family Limited Partnership + annual exclusion gifts
- D) Grantor Retained Income Trust (GRIT)

**Student's Response**: [Worked through analysis]

**Correct Answer**: **A) Self-Canceling Installment Note (SCIN)**

**SCIN (Self-Canceling Installment Note) Explained**:

**How it works**:
- Seller (Ethan) sells property to buyers (children) for installment note
- Children make regular payments to Ethan
- **Special feature**: If Ethan dies before note paid off, remaining payments CANCELLED
- Children get property free and clear at death

**Why SCIN is PERFECT for Ethan**:

**Cash flow**: ✅
- Receives installment payments during lifetime
- Can pay for health care expenses

**Estate tax benefit**: ✅✅✅
- If dies during note term, remaining debt CANCELLED
- Property OUT of estate
- With shortened life expectancy: HIGH probability dies before note paid off
- **This is TEXTBOOK use case for SCIN**

**Example**:
```
Sells $2.5M property, 10-year SCIN
Children pay $250K/year + interest
Ethan dies in year 3
  - Children received $2.5M property
  - Only paid $750K (3 payments)
  - Remaining $1.75M debt: CANCELLED
  - Property: OUT of Ethan's estate
```

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

**Private Annuity (B)**: ❌
- With shortened life expectancy, annuity valued HIGHER (actuarial)
- Children pay more than property worth
- Unsecured obligation (no collateral)
- Less favorable than SCIN

**FLP + Annual Gifts (C)**: ❌
- Annual exclusion: $18K × 4 children = $72K/year
- Need to transfer: $2.5M
- Time: $2.5M ÷ $72K = 35 years
- Fatal flaw: Ethan doesn't have 35 years (shortened life expectancy)!

**GRIT (D)**: ❌
- Doesn't work for family members (IRC §2702)
- IRS values retained interest at ZERO for family
- Must survive term or property back in estate
- High risk with shortened life expectancy

**Key Learning - When to Use Each**:

| Strategy | Best When | Ethan's Fit? |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| SCIN | Shortened life expectancy | ✅ PERFECT |
| Private Annuity | Normal life expectancy | ❌ Actuarial issue |
| FLP + Gifts | Long time horizon (10+ years) | ❌ Takes too long |
| GRIT | Non-family transfers | ❌ Doesn't work for family |

**SCIN vs Regular Installment Sale**:
- Regular: If seller dies, note is asset in estate (no benefit)
- SCIN: If seller dies, note CANCELS (estate tax savings!)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood the matching of strategy to situation

### Question 9: Annual Exclusion Gift Maximum (G.57)

**Topic**: G.57 Gift, estate, and GST tax compliance and calculation - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Married couple with 2 adult married children (no grandchildren). Maximum aggregate amount parents can give together using annual federal gift exclusions to children and spouses without using applicable exclusion amount?

**Options**:
- A) $34,000
- B) $68,000
- C) $136,000 ✓
- D) $12,920,000

**Student's Response**: [Worked through calculation]

**Correct Answer**: **C) $136,000**

**The Setup**:
- **Donors**: Married couple = 2 parents
- **Recipients**: 2 children + 2 spouses = 4 recipients

**Annual Exclusion Rules**:
- Per donor, per donee, per year
- 2023 amount: $17,000 (based on answer choices)
- Each spouse can make separate gifts

**The Calculation**:

**Parent 1 gives to**:
- Child 1: $17,000
- Child 1's spouse: $17,000
- Child 2: $17,000
- Child 2's spouse: $17,000
- Subtotal: $68,000

**Parent 2 gives to**:
- Child 1: $17,000
- Child 1's spouse: $17,000
- Child 2: $17,000
- Child 2's spouse: $17,000
- Subtotal: $68,000

**Total**: $68,000 + $68,000 = **$136,000**

**Formula**: # of donors × # of donees × annual exclusion
= 2 parents × 4 recipients × $17,000 = $136,000

**Visual Breakdown**:
```
                Child 1   Spouse 1  Child 2   Spouse 2
Parent 1:       $17K      $17K      $17K      $17K      = $68K
Parent 2:       $17K      $17K      $17K      $17K      = $68K
                ──────────────────────────────────────
Total:          $34K      $34K      $34K      $34K      = $136K
```

**Why Other Answers Wrong**:
- **$34,000**: Only 2 recipients or 1 parent (forgot spouses or second parent)
- **$68,000**: One parent to all 4 recipients (forgot both parents give)
- **$12,920,000**: Lifetime exclusion amount (confused annual vs lifetime)

**Key Concepts**:
- Annual exclusion is per donor, per donee, per year
- Can give to your child AND child's spouse (separate people)
- "Without using applicable exclusion amount" = stay within annual limits

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood the multiplication correctly

### Question 10: Gross Estate with 3-Year Lookback Rule (G.57)

**Topic**: G.57 Gift, estate, and GST tax compliance and calculation - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: At death, client held:
- Investment account $400K JTWROS with spouse
- Cash account $5K in client's name
- Life insurance $100K death benefit, transferred to ILIT exactly 1 year and 1 day earlier
What is gross estate?

**Options**:
- A) $205,000
- B) $305,000 ✓
- C) $405,000
- D) $505,000

**Student's Response**: [Worked through calculation]

**Correct Answer**: **B) $305,000**

**Gross Estate Calculation**:

**Asset 1: Investment Account JTWROS with Spouse ($400K)**:
- IRC §2040 - Joint property with spouse
- 50% included in deceased spouse's gross estate
- Included: $400,000 × 50% = **$200,000**

**Asset 2: Cash Account ($5K)**:
- Solely owned property = 100% included
- Included: **$5,000**

**Asset 3: Life Insurance ($100K death benefit)**:
- **IRC §2035 - The 3-Year Lookback Rule**
- Transfer to ILIT: 1 year + 1 day ago
- Time elapsed: 1 year + 1 day < 3 years ✓
- Rule: If transferred life insurance within 3 years of death → included in gross estate
- Included: **$100,000**

**Total Gross Estate**:
```
Investment (50% JTWROS):  $200,000
Cash (solely owned):      $  5,000
Life insurance (3-yr):    $100,000
───────────────────────────────────
Total:                    $305,000
```

**The 3-Year Lookback Rule (IRC §2035)**:

**Purpose**: Prevent deathbed transfers to avoid estate tax

**The Rule**: If decedent transferred life insurance on their own life within 3 years of death, the death benefit is included in gross estate

**Timeline in this case**:
- Transfer: 1 year + 1 day ago
- Death: Today
- 1 year + 1 day < 3 years → INCLUDED!

**Why Other Answers Wrong**:
- **$205,000**: Missing life insurance (forgot 3-year rule)
- **$405,000**: Used 100% JTWROS instead of 50% for spouses
- **$505,000**: Correct insurance, but used 100% JTWROS instead of 50%

**ILIT Strategy and Timing**:

**Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)**:
- Transfer life insurance to trust
- Trust owns policy, pays premiums
- Death benefit NOT in estate (if done properly)

**Critical Timing**: Must transfer MORE than 3 years before death!

**This client's mistake**:
- Created ILIT only 1 year before death
- Should have done it at least 3 years + 1 day earlier
- Now $100K is in estate anyway!

**Planning Takeaway**: Do ILITs early (young and healthy)! The 3-year rule makes deathbed ILITs ineffective.

**JTWROS Estate Tax Rules**:
- Spouses: 50% included (IRC §2040(b))
- Non-spouses: 100% unless prove contribution (IRC §2040(a))

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood both JTWROS and 3-year rule

## Additional Practice Problems - Estate Liquidity Deep Dive

### Question 11: Estate Liquidity for Family Business Owner (G.58)

**Topic**: G.58 Sources for estate liquidity - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Mara (72, retiree) owns large family business and multiple real estate properties. Concerned about estate liquidity for taxes, debts, final expenses. Wants to minimize disruption to business and family holdings. Effective strategies?

**Options**:
- A) Selling minority shares to public market
- B) Utilizing installment payments for estate tax ✓
- C) Obtaining line of credit secured by real estate
- D) Investing in high-yield stocks for immediate cash flow

**Student's Response**: [Worked through analysis]

**Correct Answer**: **B) Utilizing installment payments for estate tax (IRC Section 6166)**

**Mara's Situation Analysis**:
- Assets: Large family business (illiquid), multiple real estate (illiquid)
- Problem: Estate needs CASH for taxes/expenses, but assets are illiquid
- Goal: Create liquidity WITHOUT disrupting business/properties

**IRC Section 6166 - Installment Payment of Estate Tax**:

**How it works**:
- Pay estate tax over **14 years**
- Interest-only for first 4-5 years
- Then principal + interest
- Special low interest rate (2% on first $1.7M, then 45% of regular rate)

**Requirements**:
- Closely-held business must exceed **35% of adjusted gross estate**
- Mara likely qualifies with large family business

**Why PERFECT for Mara**:

✅ **Provides liquidity over time**:
- Estate doesn't need huge lump sum immediately
- Pay tax gradually from business cash flow

✅ **Minimizes disruption**:
- NO forced sale of business required
- Business stays in family and continues operating
- Properties remain intact

✅ **Classic estate liquidity tool**:
- Designed specifically for estates with family businesses
- Textbook solution for her situation

**Example**:
```
Estate tax due: $2,000,000
Without §6166: Must pay immediately (force business sale)
With §6166:
  - Years 1-5: Interest-only (~$40K/year)
  - Years 6-14: Principal + interest (~$240K/year)
  - Business generates cash to pay over time
```

**Why Other Options Wrong**:

**A) Selling minority shares to public (IPO)**: ❌
- Extremely disruptive (opposite of goal!)
- Complex, expensive process (6-12+ months)
- Loss of privacy and control
- Public scrutiny of family business
- Doesn't directly address estate liquidity at death
- Going public = maximum disruption

**C) Line of credit secured by real estate**: ❌
- Timing issues (need to establish during lifetime)
- Creates new liability, doesn't create true liquidity
- Lenders may call loan at death
- Borrowing isn't same as liquidity
- Section 6166 is far superior

**D) High-yield stocks for cash flow**: ❌
- Generates income during LIFE, not at death
- Estate liquidity needed AFTER death
- Current income doesn't help with estate taxes
- High risk for 72-year-old retiree
- Doesn't solve illiquid asset problem

**Additional Estate Liquidity Strategies** (not listed):

**Other effective tools**:
- **Life insurance**: Death benefit provides immediate cash
- **Section 303 Stock Redemption**: Corporation redeems stock (capital gain treatment)
- **Section 2032A Special Use Valuation**: Value farm/business real estate at current use

**Why Section 6166 is Perfect Here**:
- ✅ Has closely-held family business (qualifies)
- ✅ Business likely >35% of estate
- ✅ Wants to keep business in family
- ✅ Wants to avoid disruption
- ✅ Time to pay from business cash flow

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood matching strategy to situation

### Question 12: Immediate Estate Liquidity Sources (G.58)

**Topic**: G.58 Sources for estate liquidity - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Michael planning estate, concerned about liquidity for expenses/debts/taxes. Owns stocks/bonds portfolio, vacation home, $500K life insurance, $50K checking. Goal: structured plan for immediate and ongoing cash flow. Which sources provide immediate estate liquidity?

**Options**:
- A) Selling stocks and bonds from portfolio ✓
- B) Borrowing against vacation home
- C) Accessing retirement account funds
- D) Collecting rental income from tenant

**Student's Response**: [Worked through analysis]

**Correct Answer**: **A) Selling stocks and bonds from his portfolio**

**Michael's Assets**:
- Stocks and bonds portfolio (liquid)
- Vacation home (illiquid)
- Life insurance $500K death benefit (very liquid at death)
- Checking account $50K (immediately liquid)

**Need**: Immediate liquidity after death

**Analysis of Each Option**:

**Option A - Selling Stocks/Bonds**: ✅ **IMMEDIATE**

**Why this provides immediate liquidity**:
- ✅ Highly liquid asset class
- ✅ Executor can sell within days to weeks
- ✅ Trade daily on exchanges
- ✅ Fast settlement (T+2 for stocks)
- ✅ Established market value
- ✅ No need for buyer financing

**Estate use**:
- Sell securities to raise cash quickly
- Pay estate taxes, debts, expenses
- Distribute remaining assets

**Conclusion**: ✅ **EXCELLENT immediate liquidity source**

---

**Option B - Borrowing Against Vacation Home**: ❌ **NOT immediate**

**Problems**:
- ❌ Complex and time-consuming (months)
- ❌ Lenders reluctant to lend to estates
- ❌ Need appraisal, title work during probate
- ❌ Creates liability, not true liquidity
- ❌ Estate still owes the money
- ❌ Better to just sell assets if needed

**Conclusion**: ❌ **NOT effective for immediate liquidity**

---

**Option C - Accessing Retirement Account Funds**: ❌ **NOT estate liquidity**

**The key issue: Beneficiary designation**

**If beneficiary designated (typical)**:
- Retirement account passes **directly to beneficiary**
- NOT part of probate estate
- NOT available to pay estate debts/taxes
- Beneficiary receives funds, not estate
- This is beneficiary's money, not estate liquidity

**If NO beneficiary**:
- Goes through probate
- May be available to estate
- But slow (months to years)
- NOT immediate

**Why this doesn't work**:
- Retirement accounts typically have beneficiaries
- Bypass probate = bypass estate
- Estate can't access these funds
- Even if estate is beneficiary, not immediate

**Conclusion**: ❌ **Generally NOT estate liquidity**

---

**Option D - Collecting Rental Income**: ❌ **NOT immediate**

**Why not immediate liquidity**:
- ❌ Ongoing income, not lump sum
- ❌ Trickles in monthly ($2K-$3K/month)
- ❌ Estate needs hundreds of thousands NOW
- ❌ Estate taxes due within 9 months

**Timing mismatch**:
- Rental income accumulates slowly
- Not enough for immediate expenses
- Better for ongoing administration costs

**What rental income IS good for**:
- Ongoing estate administration expenses
- Property maintenance during probate
- Small recurring costs

**Conclusion**: ❌ **NOT immediate liquidity**

---

**Estate Liquidity Sources Ranked**:

**Immediate liquidity (days to weeks)**:
1. ✅ Life insurance death benefit (he has $500K - BEST!)
2. ✅ Checking account (he has $50K)
3. ✅ Stocks and bonds (days to sell)
4. ✅ Money market accounts

**Medium-term (weeks to months)**:
- Selling vacation home (3-6 months)
- CDs when mature

**NOT estate liquidity**:
- ❌ Retirement accounts (go to beneficiaries)
- ❌ Life insurance with beneficiary (goes to beneficiary)

**NOT immediate**:
- ❌ Rental income (ongoing, not lump sum)
- ❌ Borrowing (complex, slow, creates debt)

**Important Note on Life Insurance**:

**Question mentions $500K life insurance** - Typically BEST immediate liquidity!

**If insurance has beneficiary**:
- Goes directly to beneficiary (not estate)
- Fast payout (2-4 weeks)
- But not available for estate expenses

**If estate is beneficiary**:
- Available for estate expenses ✓
- Still fast payout
- Ideal for paying estate taxes

**Many estate plans**:
- Name estate as life insurance beneficiary
- Specifically to create estate liquidity
- Common planning technique

**Structured Estate Liquidity Plan for Michael**:

**Immediate (first 30-90 days)**:
- Use checking account ($50K)
- Life insurance proceeds (if estate is beneficiary)
- Sell most liquid stocks/bonds

**Medium-term (first year)**:
- Continue selling securities as needed
- Rental income for ongoing costs
- Consider selling vacation home if needed

**Long-term distribution**:
- Remaining securities to beneficiaries
- Real property to heirs

**Key Concepts Learned**:

**Immediate liquidity**: Assets converted to cash in days/weeks
**Estate assets**: Go through probate, available to pay debts/taxes
**Non-probate assets**: Pass directly to beneficiaries, NOT available to estate

**Critical distinction**: Retirement accounts and life insurance (with beneficiaries) are NOT estate liquidity - they bypass the estate!

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood estate vs. beneficiary assets

## Additional Practice Problems - Follow-up Session

### Question 13: CRT Taxation - 4-Tier Ordering Rules (G.59)

**Topic**: G.59 Types, features, and taxation of trusts - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Student's Question**: "For CRT, there is a tax deduction when set it up for charity, how about the annual payment, should the receipt pay income tax for that or not?"

**Student's Initial Understanding**:
- "I think it will be tax as ordinary income but does that come with basis calculation or not?"
- ✓ Correct that payments ARE taxed
- ? Questioned whether it uses basis calculation like annuities

**Correct Answer**: Payments ARE taxed, but NOT using basis calculation

**CRT 4-Tier Ordering Rules Explained**:

**How CRT Distributions Are Taxed**:

CRT uses a **4-tier waterfall system** - worst tax treatment first:

**Tier 1: Ordinary Income** (taxed at ordinary rates)
- Interest income
- Non-qualified dividends
- Rental income
- Business income
- **Rule**: Uses up ALL Tier 1 income earned by trust FIRST (FIFO)

**Tier 2: Capital Gains** (taxed at capital gains rates)
- Short-term capital gains (higher rate)
- Long-term capital gains (lower rate)
- **Rule**: Uses up Tier 2 only AFTER Tier 1 exhausted

**Tier 3: Tax-Exempt Income** (tax-free!)
- Municipal bond interest
- **Rule**: Only after Tiers 1 & 2 completely distributed

**Tier 4: Return of Principal** (tax-free!)
- Return of trust corpus
- **Rule**: Only after ALL income (Tiers 1-3) distributed

**Key Difference from Annuities**:

| Feature | Annuity (Exclusion Ratio) | CRT (4-Tier System) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Tax treatment | Each payment partly ordinary income, partly basis | Each payment follows tier ordering |
| Basis recovery | Proportional (every payment) | Last (Tier 4 only) |
| Character | All taxable portion = ordinary income | Maintains character (ordinary, capital gain, tax-free) |

**Example Calculation**:

**Trust earned (cumulative)**:
- Year 1: $30K dividends (Tier 1)
- Year 2: $15K long-term gains (Tier 2)
- Year 3: $10K municipal interest (Tier 3)

**Beneficiary receives $50K payment in Year 3**:
- First $30K: Ordinary income (Tier 1 - dividends)
- Next $15K: Long-term capital gains (Tier 2)
- Next $5K: Long-term capital gains (if available from prior years) OR
- Next $5K: Tax-exempt (Tier 3 - municipal interest)

**NOT** proportional like annuity (e.g., 60% ordinary, 40% basis)

**Why 4-Tier System Exists**:
- Preserves character of income
- Prevents conversion of ordinary income to capital gains
- Ensures IRS gets worst tax treatment first
- Beneficiary can't cherry-pick tax-favored income

**CRT Planning Implications**:

**Good CRT investments**:
- Growth stocks (hold for long-term gains - Tier 2)
- Municipal bonds (tax-exempt - Tier 3)
- Minimize ordinary income investments

**Poor CRT investments**:
- High-dividend stocks (ordinary income - Tier 1)
- Taxable bonds (ordinary income - Tier 1)
- REITs (ordinary income - Tier 1)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student correctly identified that payments are taxed, just needed clarification on the tier system vs. basis calculation

### Question 14: QDOT and Marital Deduction (G.60)

**Topic**: G.60 Marital deduction - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Sylvia (U.S. citizen) and Alexander (citizen of Greece). Sylvia has $10M+ estate. How does QDOT affect applicability of marital deduction?

**Options**:
- A) Allow Alexander to receive unlimited distributions free of estate tax
- B) Enable the marital deduction to apply to the entire estate for Alexander's benefit ✓
- C) Beneficial only if Alexander plans to immigrate to U.S. permanently
- D) Necessitates surviving spouse to be treated as domestic beneficiary for trust to maintain tax benefits

**Student's Initial Understanding**:
- "Marital deduction only applies to US citizen that's why the foreigners need QDOT"
- "QDOT will help to get the unlimited marital deduction"
- "But still need to pay estate tax when give to the beneficiary like child"
- ✓ EXCELLENT conceptual understanding!

**Student's Answer**: D (Incorrect)

**Student's Reasoning**: "It says 'treated as' so that just mean you are not but you are treated as right?"

**Correct Answer**: **B) Enable the marital deduction to apply to the entire estate for Alexander's benefit**

**QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust) Explained**:

**The Problem Without QDOT**:
- Marital deduction = unlimited, tax-free transfer to spouse
- BUT only for **U.S. citizen spouses**
- Why? IRS worries non-citizen spouse could take money and leave U.S., avoiding estate tax forever

**QDOT Solution**:

✅ **Allows unlimited marital deduction** at first spouse's death (Sylvia's death)
- Without QDOT: Alexander is non-citizen → marital deduction = $0
- With QDOT: Alexander still non-citizen → marital deduction = UNLIMITED ($10M)

✅ **Defers estate tax** - doesn't eliminate it

⚠️ **Estate tax is paid later** in two situations:

1. **Distributions to Alexander during his lifetime** (except for hardship/income)
   - Principal distribution → estate tax due immediately
   - Income distributions → NO estate tax (Alexander pays income tax only)

2. **At Alexander's death**
   - Remaining QDOT assets → estate tax due
   - Taxed as if still in Sylvia's estate

**Why B is Correct**:

**This is EXACTLY what QDOT does!**
- **Enable** = makes possible (wasn't possible before)
- **Marital deduction to apply** = gets the deduction that was blocked for non-citizen
- **To the entire estate** = unlimited (full $10M)

Student said: "QDOT will help to get the unlimited marital deduction" - **that's answer B!**

**Why D is Wrong**:

**"Necessitates surviving spouse to be treated as domestic beneficiary"**

This is **backwards logic**:
- Alexander does NOT become a "domestic beneficiary"
- He's STILL a non-citizen
- QDOT doesn't make him "domestic" - it's a **workaround** for non-citizens

**If Alexander were truly "treated as domestic," he would get SAME treatment as U.S. citizen**:

| Feature | U.S. Citizen Spouse | Alexander with QDOT |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Unlimited marital deduction | ✓ | ✓ |
| Distributions tax-free | ✓ | ✗ (principal taxed!) |
| At death, fresh estate tax basis | ✓ | ✗ (taxed as if Sylvia's!) |
| U.S. trustee required | ✗ | ✓ (must have!) |

**So Alexander is NOT "treated as domestic" - he gets hybrid treatment!**

**Why Other Answers Wrong**:

**A) Unlimited distributions free of estate tax**: ❌
- Principal distributions TRIGGER estate tax
- Only income distributions are free of estate tax
- This is opposite of what answer A says

**C) Beneficial only if Alexander immigrates permanently**: ❌
- QDOT benefits apply whether or not he immigrates
- Alexander can stay in Greece and still get marital deduction
- Immigration is irrelevant to QDOT function

**QDOT Requirements**:
1. At least one trustee must be U.S. citizen or domestic corporation
2. No distribution of principal unless U.S. trustee has right to withhold estate tax
3. Executor must make irrevocable QDOT election on estate tax return
4. Trust must meet regulatory requirements

**Estate Tax Timing**:

**Without QDOT**:
- Estate tax at Sylvia's death: $10M × 40% = **$4M tax NOW**

**With QDOT**:
- Estate tax at Sylvia's death: **$0** (marital deduction)
- Estate tax when Alexander takes principal: **Tax on distribution**
- Estate tax at Alexander's death: **Tax on remaining assets**

**Planning Considerations**:

**QDOT is better when**:
- Want to defer estate tax
- Spouse needs income (not principal)
- Time value of money benefit from deferral

**Direct gift to non-citizen spouse without QDOT**:
- Can use lifetime exemption ($13.61M in 2024)
- But no marital deduction
- Estate tax at first death

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood the concept correctly, just needed clarification on answer wording. "Treated as domestic" vs. "enables marital deduction" distinction.

### Question 15: Irrevocable Trust Estate Reduction (G.59)

**Topic**: G.59 Types, features, and taxation of trusts - Estate Planning domain (10% of exam)

**Problem Given**: Franklin established irrevocable trust with $800K appreciated real estate. Income ($40K annually from leases) paid to grandchildren annually. Property distributed outright at age 30. Intent: minimize estate taxes, provide for education/future needs. How does trust impact Franklin's tax liability and beneficiaries' financial outcome?

**Options**:
- A) Franklin's taxable estate is reduced by the value of the trust upon creation ✓
- B) The trust itself pays income taxes on the $40,000 earned annually
- C) The beneficiaries must report the $40,000 as income and pay taxes at their rates
- D) The grandchildren inherit the property with a step-up in basis upon Franklin's death

**Student's Initial Understanding**:
- "1 trust pays it 2 receipt pays it"
- "I think since it's distributed so the receipt should pay it"
- ✓ CORRECT understanding of trust income taxation!
- Questioned why C is not the answer

**Correct Answer**: **A) Franklin's taxable estate is reduced by the value of the trust upon creation**

**Why A is the BEST Answer**:

**The Question Asks**: "How would this trust IMPACT Franklin's tax liability and beneficiaries' financial outcome?"

Key word: **IMPACT** - what CHANGES because of the trust?

**Estate Tax Impact**:
- Before trust: $800K property in Franklin's estate → estate tax on it
- After trust: $800K property REMOVED from estate → **NO estate tax**
- **This directly addresses Franklin's stated goal**: "minimize future estate taxes"

✅ This is a CHANGE/IMPACT caused by creating the irrevocable trust

**Why C is Not Wrong, But Not the BEST Answer**:

**C) The beneficiaries must report the $40,000 as income and pay taxes at their rates**

**Student was RIGHT about the tax mechanics!**
- Trust document says: "income...is to be paid to the grandchildren annually"
- Income is distributed → beneficiaries pay the tax
- This IS technically correct

**But why C is not the BEST answer**:
- This is just **normal income tax treatment**
- This would happen whether or not there's a trust (rental income gets taxed somewhere)
- It's not really an "impact" or special consequence of creating the trust
- It doesn't address estate tax (Franklin's PRIMARY goal)

**Think of it this way**:
- **C describes WHO pays the tax** (technically correct, but procedural)
- **A describes THE BENEFIT** (estate tax savings - the actual impact/goal)

**Why B is Wrong**:

**B) The trust itself pays income taxes on the $40,000 earned annually**

**DNI (Distributable Net Income) Rules**:
- Trust earns income AND distributes it → beneficiaries pay tax
- Trust earns income and KEEPS it → trust pays tax
- Here, income "is to be paid to grandchildren annually" → distributed
- So BENEFICIARIES pay tax, not trust

**Why D is Wrong**:

**D) The grandchildren inherit the property with a step-up in basis upon Franklin's death**

**Step-up in Basis Rules**:
- Step-up happens for assets IN the decedent's estate at death
- Irrevocable trust: Property OUT of Franklin's estate
- Property already gifted to trust (completed gift)
- Grandchildren receive property at age 30 with **carryover basis** (Franklin's original basis)
- NO step-up because not in Franklin's estate

**This is a trade-off**: Estate tax savings vs. loss of step-up

**Trust Income Taxation Summary**:

**Simple Trust** (must distribute all income):
- Income distributed → beneficiaries pay tax
- Trust gets deduction for distributions

**Complex Trust** (can accumulate income):
- Income distributed → beneficiaries pay tax
- Income retained → trust pays tax (higher rates!)

**This trust** (complex because distributes to property):
- Income: Distributed annually → **beneficiaries pay income tax** ✓ (C is correct on mechanics)
- Principal: Held until age 30 → distributed then

**The Complete Picture**:

**Franklin's situation**:
1. ✅ **Estate tax**: Reduced by $800K (Answer A - PRIMARY BENEFIT)
2. ✅ **Income tax**: Grandchildren pay on $40K annually (Answer C - correct but procedural)
3. ❌ **Step-up lost**: Property will have carryover basis, not step-up
4. ✅ **Goal achieved**: Estate tax minimization successful

**Planning Trade-offs**:

**Option 1: Keep in estate (no trust)**:
- Estate tax: Owe tax on $800K
- Step-up: ✓ YES (grandchildren get stepped-up basis)
- Control: Franklin controls until death

**Option 2: Irrevocable trust (what Franklin did)**:
- Estate tax: ✓ SAVED (not in estate)
- Step-up: ❌ NO (carryover basis)
- Control: Lost control immediately

**Which is better?**
- If estate under exemption: Keep in estate (get step-up)
- If estate over exemption: Irrevocable trust (save estate tax)

**Franklin's $10M+ estate**: Estate tax savings > step-up benefit, so trust makes sense

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Student understood trust income taxation correctly, just needed to understand the question was asking about the PRIMARY IMPACT (estate tax), not the income tax mechanics.

**Key Learning**:
- On exam, distinguish "technically correct" from "BEST answer to the question asked"
- Look for the PRIMARY PURPOSE/IMPACT when multiple answers could be correct
- "How does this IMPACT..." questions want the main benefit/consequence, not procedural details
